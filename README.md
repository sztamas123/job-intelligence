# Job Intelligence System

An automated job intelligence system that aggregates, normalizes, and scores job postings from multiple sources.

This project is designed as a backend automation pipeline rather than a traditional web application.

## Goals

- Collect job postings from multiple sources
- Normalize heterogeneous job data into a single schema
- Score job relevance based on configurable criteria
- Run automatically via scheduled execution (CI)
- Produce clear, human-readable outputs

## Non-Goals 

- No spam or fully automated job applications
- No CAPTCHA bypassing or ToS violations
- No public-facing web UI
